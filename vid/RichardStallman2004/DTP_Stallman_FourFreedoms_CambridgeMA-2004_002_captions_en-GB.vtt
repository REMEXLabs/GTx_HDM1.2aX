00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:09.040
Anyway, free software means software that
respects the user's freedom.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.920
Now, to be more specific, there are four essential
freedoms:

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.420
Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program
any way you like.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.300
Freedom 1 is the freedom to study the source
code

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.680
and then change it to do what you like.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.130
Freedom 2 is the freedom to distribute
copies to other people.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.239
And Freedom 3 is the freedom to publish a
modified version

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.670
so others can get the benefit of your improvements.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.570
I like to call freedoms 1, 2 and 3
"the freedom to help yourself",

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.750
"the freedom to help your neighbour"
and "the freedom to help build your community".

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.739
Freedom 1, the freedom to help yourself, is
the freedom to study and change the program.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.280
The freedom to help your neighbour is
the freedom to distribute copies.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.999
And the freedom to help build your community is

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:03.360
the freedom to contribute your improvements.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.050
Now, these freedoms are not really
something new.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.730
It may be new to people to encounter
these freedoms for software,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.860
but lots of people are used to these freedoms
for something rather similar to software,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.940
namely recipes.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.430
A program and a recipe are similar
but each of them is a series of steps

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.310
to carry out to get the results you want.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.450
Now it's true there are differences as well:
a recipe is carried out by a cook who's thinking,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.600
whereas a program is carried out by a machine.
But for this comparison

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.110
it's the similarities that matter.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.030
Because cooks are accustomed to using
recipes freely whenever they want to.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.310
And cooks are also accustomed to
looking at the ingredients,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.880
for instance to see if there's anything
that Joe is allergic to, say,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.170
or anything that Joe
doesn't like the taste of,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.450
or that the cook doesn't like the taste of.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.760
And cooks are accustomed to
changing recipes for various reasons.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.939
Cooks also are accustomed to making copies
of recipes for their friends,

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.519
getting recipes from their friends.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.709
It's a little bit less common
to write down your changed version of a recipe

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.099
and make a copy for other people,
but people do that too.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.930
So it's the same four freedoms
that cooks are accustomed to for recipes.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.230
So imagine if some day,
the government starts saying

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.099
that if you copy or change or share a recipe,
then you're a pirate and

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.780
they'll put you in prison for years.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.590
Imagine how angry people will be.
Well, that's the same anger that started

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.010
the free software movement.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.540
I said, "How dare you try to stop me
from changing software?"

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.519
"How dare you tell me that I can't
be a decent person by sharing software?"

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.620
I said I refuse to live that way.
I said I won't stand for that non-free software.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.530
So I was determined to get it out of my life,
to reject it.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.859
And that required a lot of work.
And that work is the free software movement.
