0:00:01.370,0:00:09.040
Anyway, free software means software that
respects the user's freedom.

0:00:09.040,0:00:13.920
Now, to be more specific, there are four essential
freedoms:

0:00:13.920,0:00:19.420
Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program
any way you like.

0:00:19.420,0:00:22.300
Freedom 1 is the freedom to study the source
code

0:00:22.300,0:00:25.680
and then change it to do what you like.

0:00:25.680,0:00:30.130
Freedom 2 is the freedom to distribute
copies to other people.

0:00:30.130,0:00:34.239
And Freedom 3 is the freedom to publish a
modified version

0:00:34.239,0:00:37.670
so others can get the benefit of your improvements.

0:00:37.670,0:00:41.570
I like to call freedoms 1, 2, and 3
"the freedom to help yourself",

0:00:41.570,0:00:47.750
"the freedom to help your neighbor",
and "the freedom to help build your community".

0:00:47.750,0:00:52.739
Freedom 1, the freedom to help yourself, is
the freedom to study and change the program.

0:00:52.739,0:00:56.280
The freedom to help your neighbor is
the freedom to distribute copies.

0:00:56.280,0:00:57.999
And the freedom to help build your community
is

0:00:57.999,0:01:02.409
the freedom to contribute your improvements.

0:01:02.409,0:01:09.050
Now, these freedoms are not really
something new.

0:01:09.050,0:01:13.730
It may be new to people to encounter
these freedoms for software,

0:01:13.730,0:01:18.860
but lots of people are used to these freedoms
for something rather similar to software,

0:01:18.860,0:01:20.940
namely recipes.

0:01:20.940,0:01:26.430
A program and a recipe are similar
but each of them is a series of steps

0:01:26.430,0:01:30.310
to carry out to get the results you want.

0:01:30.310,0:01:35.450
Now it's true there are differences as well:
a recipe is carried out by a cook who's thinking,

0:01:35.450,0:01:39.500
whereas a program is carried out by a machine.

0:01:39.500,0:01:44.110
But for this comparison
it's the similarities that matter.

0:01:44.110,0:01:51.030
Because cooks are accustomed to using
recipes freely whenever they want to.

0:01:51.030,0:01:54.310
And cooks are also accustomed to
looking at the ingredients,

0:01:54.310,0:01:59.880
for instance to see if there's anything
that Joe is allergic to, say,

0:01:59.880,0:02:04.170
or anything that Joe
doesn't like the taste of,

0:02:04.170,0:02:07.450
or that the cook doesn't like the taste of.

0:02:07.450,0:02:12.760
And cooks are accustomed to
changing recipes for various reasons.

0:02:12.760,0:02:16.939
Cooks also are accustomed to making copies
of recipes for their friends,

0:02:16.939,0:02:19.519
getting recipes from their friends.

0:02:19.519,0:02:24.709
It's a little bit less common
to write down your changed version of a recipe

0:02:24.709,0:02:30.099
and make a copy for other people,
but people do that too.

0:02:30.099,0:02:35.930
So it's the same four freedoms
that cooks are accustomed to for recipes.

0:02:35.930,0:02:40.230
So imagine if some day,
the government starts saying

0:02:40.230,0:02:47.099
that if you copy or change or share a recipe,
then you're a pirate and

0:02:47.099,0:02:50.780
they'll put you in prison for years.

0:02:50.780,0:02:53.469
Imagine how angry people will be.

0:02:53.469,0:02:59.010
Well, that's the same anger that started
the free software movement.

0:02:59.010,0:03:03.540
I said, "How dare you try to stop me
from changing software?"

0:03:03.540,0:03:09.519
"How dare you tell me that I can't
be a decent person by sharing software?"

0:03:09.519,0:03:15.620
I said I refuse to live that way.
I said I won't stand for that non-free software.

0:03:15.620,0:03:21.530
So I was determined to get it out of my life,
to reject it.

0:03:21.530,0:03:26.859
And that required a lot of work.
And that work is the free software movement.
