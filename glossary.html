    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This glossary was originally created for the online course
      <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/digital-accessibility">Digital Accessibility: Enabling Participation in the Information Society</a>.
      Since this course assumed only minimal previous knowledge of <abbr title="information and communication technology">ICT</abbr> and
      no previous knowledge of accessibility, the glossary also contains terms that should be familiar to experienced Internet users.
      A <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Ytr4BUNCGqNGFjeFV3YkpNcDQ">version in Microsoft docx format</a>
      and a
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Ytr4BUNCGqSU1qSWpMVVVRejg"><abbr>PDF</abbr> version</a>
      are available for download.

      <dt id="dt-aac"><abbr>AAC</abbr></dt>
        <dd>Augmentative and alternative communication, an umbrella term for methods and technologies (e.g. communication boards and speech-generating devices) that help people with a wide range of speech and language impairments to communicate with family, carers and other people.</dd>
      <dt>Accessibility</dt>
        <dd>The extent to which a product (including software, websites and documents) or service can be used by everyone, regardless of disabilities.</dd>
      <dt>Accessible cash machine (<abbr title="automated teller machine">ATM</abbr>)</dt>
        <dd>Cash machine that can be used independently by a person with a disability.</dd>
      <dt>Accessible eBooks</dt>

      <dt>Accessible documents</dt>
        <dd>Documents that can be accessed by people with disabilities.</dd>
      <dt>Accessible games</dt>
        <dd>Games that can be accessed and played by people with disabilities.</dd>
      <dt>Accessible learning &amp; teaching</dt>
        <dd>Learning and teaching that has no barriers for people with disabilities.</dd>
      <dt>Accessible mobile apps</dt>
        <dd>Applications for mobile devices that can be accessed on a mobile device by people with disabilities.</dd>
      <dt>Accessible self-service kiosks</dt>
        <dd>Kiosks (or self-service machines) that are accessible
          <ul>
            <li>in terms of their location allowing users to find and use the machine, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> not sited at the top of a flight of stairs or behind a column,</li>
            <li>in terms of their interaction style, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> content has understandable language and graphics; the task  and task flow understandable; feedback is meaningful to the user; and tolerance for human error, <abbr>etc</abbr>.</li>
            <li>in terms of their interface features, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> screens where display is visible whether a person is short or tall; alternatives to touch screens for people who cannot use them;  interface components, such as knobs, levers, slots, scanners, card readers, etc. easily distinguishable using visual, tactile and audio clues; <abbr>etc.</abbr></li>
          </ul>
          <p>These machines are commonly targeted at the public and designed for independent use in unmanned service / product delivery situations.
            As convergence between different types of internet enabled devices continues, many kiosks may act as part of the delivery chain for a series of services/products.
            Accessibility issues must  be taken into account if these services  are to be used people of different abilities.
